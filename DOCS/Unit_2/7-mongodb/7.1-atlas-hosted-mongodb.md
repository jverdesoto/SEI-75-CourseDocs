## Create an Atlas Account

The most popular service for hosting MongoDB databases, not surprisingly, is MongoDB's own [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). We'll use it to host all of our MongoDB databases in class.

First, you will need to sign up for a free account [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).

![The MongoDB Atlas Sign up page.](assets/atlas/sign-up.png)

If you want to create an account without using Sign up with Google:
1. Provide the required information. You should store this username and password somewhere easily accessible and secure (like a password manager). 
2. Read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then agree to them. 
3. Finally select the **Create your Atlas acount** option. 

If instead you would like to use Sign up with Google, select the Sign up with Google button.

### If You *Did Not* Sign Up with Google

If you used Sign up with Google, skip to the next section. If you created an account without using Sign up with Google, you'll be taken to a page asking you to verify your email, as shown below. 

![The MongoDB Atlas email verification page.](assets/atlas/email-verification.png)

Find the email from MongoDB in your inbox and verify your email. After you've verified your email, you'll be taken to a page informing you that you've successfully verified your email and a **Continue** button. Click the **Continue** button. Skip to the **Welcome to Atlas** section below.

### If You *Did* Sign Up with Google

Read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then agree to them. Select the **Submit** button.

## Deploy Your Database

It's time to set up the cluster! Clusters are MongoDB's way of collecting your databases all in one place. Select the **M0** option, which is **FREE**. Select AWS as the Provider, and select the Region closest to your job market. Name your cluster whatever you want, but know that this name **cannot** be changed later. Ensure that the text directly above the **Create** button says **FREE**. ***Do not select the Create button unless this text says FREE. If it has a dollar amount, review your selections and ensure you have correctly configured the service from this page.*** Finally, select the **Create** button.

## Security Quickstart

You will be taken to a Security Quickstart page. There will be a message at the bottom left stating that the database cluster is being provisioned, along with the approximate amount of time it will take to complete.

While the cluster is provisioned, create a **database user** (different from your account user) by following the steps in the **How would you like to authenticate your connection** section.

The database user's credentials you create now must be embedded in the connection string used to connect to the database, which you will retrieve soon.

Select a username and password. ***The username and password must be alphanumeric. They cannot contain any characters that are not English letters or numbers. Do not use special characters of any kind, including spaces.*** Feel free to use the **Autogenerate Secure Password** option if you would like or use the default selections; it will only build passwords that meet this constraint. It is vital that you store this username and password somewhere easily accessible and secure (like a password manager). Use the provided **Copy** button to ensure you have an exact copy of your chosen password. You are going to need access to this information soon. After you have selected a username and password, select **Create User**.

![The first step of the MongoDB Atlas Security Quickstart page.](assets/atlas/security-quickstart-1.png)

The page should look like this after this step:

![The completed first step of the MongoDB Atlas Security Quickstart page.](assets/atlas/security-quickstart-1-complete.png)

Scroll down to the second step: **Where would you like to connect from?**

In the **IP Address** field, enter the text `0.0.0.0/0` exactly as shown here. In the description, write `Anywhere`. Then click the **Add Entry** button.

> IMPORTANT: This is ***NOT*** a suitable setting in a production environment and means that your database can be accessed from any device that has the correct username and password combination. We are using this setting to ensure you can easily develop and deploy to aid your educational experience. For this reason (among others), it is imperative that you not store personally identifying information (phone numbers, addresses, credit card numbers or details, insurance identification, your lucky numbers, etc. in your database.)

![The second step of the MongoDB Atlas Security Quickstart page.](assets/atlas/security-quickstart-2.png)

The page should look like this after this step. Select the **Finish and Close** button and then the **Go to Overview** button in the pop-up.

## Obtain the Connection String

> IMPORTANT: Database connection strings contain the username and password for connecting to the database. Never include the connection string in the project's source code - use a .env file instead.

You will arrive on the Overview page. To obtain the connection string that will be added to a project's `.env` file, click the **Connect** button as shown below:

![The MongoDB Atlas Overview page.](assets/atlas/overview.png)

Select the only option under the **Connect to your application** header, **Drivers**:

![The connection methods provided by MongoDB Atlas.](assets/atlas/connection-method.png)

Click the copy button to add the connection string to your clipboard. You do not need to do anything else on this page.

## Use the Connection String in Your App

> Please do not attempt to use any of the connection strings below; they will not function in your applications.

You're almost done, but you ***MUST*** update the connection string with a few changes:

1. Replace `<password>` (including the `<` and the `>`) with the password of the database user you created earlier.
    
    For example, using the password `my2Tacos` along with the connection string above as an example, the connection string would look like this after making this change:

    ```text
    mongodb+srv://student:my2Tacos@student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

2. **IMPORTANT**: The connection string does not include a database name by default. You'll add an appropriate database name between the `/?` part of the connection string for each project.  For example, if you have a project named `mongoose-movies`, you could give the database the same name:

    ```text
    mongodb+srv://student:my2Tacos@student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/mongoose-movies?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

You're good to go!

You can now paste the connection string in an application's `.env` file, assigning it to a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. As an example:

```text
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://student:<password>@student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```


üéâ Save the copied database connection string in a safe place for future reference! You will be using it in several projects.

> For future projects, continue to use the same connection string - just be sure to change the database name part of the connection string, as mentioned above. For example, if you were to build a flights app, you might have a connection string that looks like this:
>
> ```text
> mongodb+srv://student:my2Tacos@student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/flights?retryWrites=true&w=majority
> ```
>
> And if you were to build a tacos app, you might have a connection string that looks like:
>
> ```text
> mongodb+srv://student:my2Tacos@student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/tacos?retryWrites=true&w=majority
> ```
>
> All that changes is the text between the `/` and the `?` towards the end of the connection string!

## Viewing & Editing Data

You can use Atlas to view and edit data by clicking on the `Browse Collections` button on the Database Deployments page, as shown below.

MongoDB also maintains an application called Compass that lets you browse your data on Atlas with just your connection string. You can download Compass [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

## Test Drive in the Mongo Shell

Click the **Connect** button again on the Overview page, and this time select **Shell** under the **Access your data through tools** header:

![Accessing the Shell connection from within Atlas](assets/atlas/shell.png)

Although Atlas may show how to permanently install `mongosh` (MongoDB's Shell) for your operating system, **it is unnecessary.**

Instead, we can temporarily install and run `mongosh` by copying and pasting the command shown in Atlas into Terminal. 

![The shell connection steps. Only step 2 is important for us.](assets/atlas/shell-connection.png)

‚ùóÔ∏è Before pressing enter, add `npx ` to the front of the command so that the command looks something like this:

```
npx mongosh "mongodb+srv://student-cluster.uwdsn12.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username yourusername
```

If prompted to install, be sure to answer with `y`.

You will be prompted to enter your **database user's** password.

Congrats, you are now ready to test the database in the **Intro to MongoDB** lesson!
