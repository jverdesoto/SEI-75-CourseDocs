# SEI Cafe Order History Lab

## Intro

SEI CAFE has only one page-level component remaining to code: `<OrderHistoryPage>`

You have the know how to finish SEI CAFE, right here, right now!

## Setup

We're going to continue to build out SEI CAFE from where the _MERN Shopping Cart Part 2_ lesson left off.

### If Not Finished with _MERN Shopping Cart Part 2_

If you have not yet had a chance to finish that lesson and would like to later, please make a copy of your sei-cafe project in its current state with these commands:

- `cd ~/code/sei-cafe`

- `cp -R sei-cafe sei-cafe-before-history`

### Optionally Sync With _MERN Shopping Cart Part 2_ Code

- `git fetch --all`

- `git reset --hard origin/sync-cafe-14-history-starter`

## ðŸ‘‰ New Starter Code

Let's prep the `<OrderHistoryPage>` so that it correctly renders the left-hand pane...

Update `src/pages/OrderHistoryPage/OrderHistoryPage.jsx` to:

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import './OrderHistoryPage.css';
import Logo from '../../components/Logo/Logo';
import UserLogOut from '../../components/UserLogOut/UserLogOut';

export default function OrderHistoryPage({ user, setUser }) {
  return (
    <main className="OrderHistoryPage">
      <aside>
        <Logo />
        <Link to="/orders/new" className="button btn-sm">NEW ORDER</Link>
        <UserLogOut user={user} setUser={setUser} />
      </aside>
      {/* Render an OrderList component (needs to be coded) */}

      {/* Render the existing OrderDetail component */}

    </main>
  );
}
```

Create a new `src/pages/OrderHistoryPage/OrderHistoryPage.css` with the following CSS:

```css
.OrderHistoryPage {
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1.6fr 3.5fr 3fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr;
  background-color: var(--white);
  border-radius: 2vmin;
}

.OrderHistoryPage aside {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 3vmin 2vmin;
}
```

Finally, the new code depends on the `user` and `setUser` props being passed to `<OrderHistoryPage>` in `App.jsx` in the same way they are being passed to `<NewOrderPage>`:

```jsx
// App.jsx

...
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/orders/new" element={<NewOrderPage user={user} setUser={setUser} />} />
          {/* Add the user & setUser props to the line below */}
          <Route path="/orders" element={<OrderHistoryPage user={user} setUser={setUser} />} />
...
```

The Order History page should now we rendering like the following:

## Exercises

Code the `<OrderHistoryPage>` such that it looks (as close as possible) and functions like [the deployed SEI CAFE](https://sei-cafe.herokuapp.com/orders):

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Evv6VCx.png">

Use the above wireframe/component hierarchy and the deployed app as a guide to implement the following user stories...

### AAU, I want to see a list of summary information for each of my prior orders.

You're basically being asked to implement the **index** functionality for the **orders** resource, .i.e., fetch and render all orders for the logged in user.

> ðŸ‘€ This is a user-centric application, please be sure to render the orders that belong to the logged in user only. 

### AAU, I want to view the details of a previous order when I click on its summary information.

This functionality is similar to the selected category functionality we coded in `<NewOrderPage>`.

> ðŸ‘€ Implementing this user story will be gravy - we already finished coding `<OrderDetail>` and used it in `<NewOrderPage>`. It includes the logic to render an unpaid order (cart in the `<NewOrderPage>`) and a paid order for you in `<OrderHistoryPage>`. 

## Hints

- The code we've written together has taught you everything you need to know - be sure to examine the starter code because it provides similar code for everything you need to do.

- Refer to the models for the property names (including virtuals) being rendered. Some data might need to be formatted to match the wireframe.

- Follow the flow when implementing features:
    ```
                                        Order Model
                                             â‡µ
    UI â†’ API Module â†’ Server Route â†’ Controller Action
     â¬‘ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ âŸµ JSON Data â†²
    ```

- An `activeOrder` (selected order) functionality is like an `activeCat` (selected category) functionality.

- Don't prioritize the CSS early on. However, examining the CSS of other components will help when the time comes to polish things up.

- Use the Elements tab of Chrome DevTools to inspect the DOM elements being rendered by [the deployed SEI CAFE](https://sei-cafe.herokuapp.com/orders).  Copying and pasting the DOM elements rendered will provide a fantastic starting point for each new component's JSX!
